//inheritance is a relationship
//Composition has a relationship
//composition is tightly coupled --> child obj cant exists without parent obj //cant work seperately or independently, object created inside another object
// Aggregation is weakly coupled // both obj can work independently
//eg car
//   _|_
//  |   |
// BMW  Audi
//all car are not BMW but all BMW are the car
//car has a engine V
//car is a engine X
